# Workspaces

When you create or join a Workspace, you can unlock advanced AI Hub capabilities such as:

* [Cloud Compiler](workspaces/cloud-compiler)
* [Creating Model Zoos](workspace-models#creating-a-model-zoo)
* [Workspace tokens for AI Hub authentication](workspaces/workspace-tokens)
* [Inviting people to the Workspace and assigning roles](workspaces/workspace-settings)

Workspaces are free during early access; charges begin after early access ends.

To access Workspaces, click the **Create new** button or the name of your active Workspace in the left-hand navigation bar of the AI Hub. The dropdown menu that appears will display the "Create new" button and Workspaces your account has joined.

Click a Workspace to select it. When your Workspace is selected, you'll see a check next to the Workspace name in the selector, and you'll be able to use Workspace-specific features like the [Cloud Compiler](workspaces/cloud-compiler).
