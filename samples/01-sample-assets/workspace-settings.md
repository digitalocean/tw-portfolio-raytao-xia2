# Workspace Settings

When you are the owner of a Workspace, you can access **Workspace Settings**. In here, you can change member roles, invite members, remove members, manage billing, and delete the Workspace.

This page will not show up if you have a Workspace selected that you do not own.

## Members

The **Members** tab features a list of members, a search bar, permission levels, and the invite button.

### Permission levels

Workspaces have two permission levels: owner and member.

* Members have access to all features enabled for the Workspace.
* Owners can edit member roles and delete the Workspace.

### Inviting people to Workspaces

Only Workspace owners can invite people to Workspaces. To invite someone, you'll need their email address. The AI Hub sends a confirmation email to the new member.
