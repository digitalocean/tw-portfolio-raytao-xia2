# Sample 02 — Motherboard printable quick reference guide

**URL:** https://www.supermicro.com/QuickRefs/motherboard/R12/QRG-2483.pdf
**Publication date:** 2022-02

## Cover Sheet (keep to 1–2 sentences per item)
**Collaboration (SME?):**  
Product Manager, Hardware Engineer, Software Engineer, Firmware Engineer

**Editing by others:**  
None

**Audience & stakeholders:**  
Engineers and technical product managers who work on the R12SPD-A motherboard so that they may easily identify components on the motherboard without needing an internet connection.

**What I learned (writing + after publishing):**  
It's my first public-facing piece published as an employee of a publicly-traded Bay Area tech company! During writing, I had to go to many stakeholders to accurately portray the product on a single sheet of paper. After publication, we found that this remains one of my greater pieces, because I ended up being the only writer to support the R12-series and later R13-series motherboards.

**How I measured success (and outcome):**  
Lack of support tickets related to items on the quick reference guide. Success of the product based on sales.

**Anything else to know:**  
This document was updated once and is a printable document. Since it's printed and included as part of a package, this means I was also aware of how much inventory of the first version of this document was available, and so the release of the second version had to occur before inventory of the first version ran out.
