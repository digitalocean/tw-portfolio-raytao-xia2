# Sample 01 — DeGirum Documentation Site's Workspaces section

**URL:** https://docs.degirum.com/ai-hub/workspaces
**Publication date:** 2025-08

## Cover Sheet (keep to 1–2 sentences per item)
**Collaboration (SME?):**  
CTO, Marketing, Cloud Team Lead, Cloud Team UX Engineer

**Editing by others:**  
None

**Audience & stakeholders:**  
Current and prospective users, Large Language Models, third-party team leads

**What I learned (writing + after publishing):**  
Believe it or not, the screenshots are partially automated. I learned to combine browser automation tools and agents, such as playwright and ChatGPT Agent mode, with Javascript to capture documentation-site friendly screenshots while keeping up with rapid software development cycles.

**How I measured success (and outcome):**  
Page views and significantly less issues raised regarding Workspace functionality by both humans and robots.

**Anything else to know:**  
A vast majority of the documentation site was personally written by me. There are a few sections that have been written by engineers but formatted to fit GitBook-style markdown; those sections are deprioritized so that I may focus on other responsibilities.
The markdown files will not render cleanly in GitHub or VSCode previewers since they're in GitBook-flavored markdown rather than GitHub-flavored markdown.
